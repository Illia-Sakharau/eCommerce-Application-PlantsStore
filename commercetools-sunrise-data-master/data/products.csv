The much beloved and rare Monstera Thai Constellation! Isnâ€™t she absolutely gorgeous?! This is a rare Monstera species that you will not find in nature. This is because she was especially created to have stable variegation. She will never stop giving you her amazing variegated leaves. Yay! :) That is a very big difference with her look-a-like, the variegated Monstera. Another big difference is that the Thai is a real crawler and the space between the nodes is way shorter than with the Monstera Variegata.",thai-constellation,,,,2023-05-12T14:00:00.000Z,10001,medium,adult,
